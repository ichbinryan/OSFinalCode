This is my final project code for Operating Systems 2

This project times encoding and decoding for various erasure code libraries.  In order to run this
you will need to install the following libraries.  Follow the instructions on the git to do so.

liberasurecode: https://github.com/openstack/liberasurecode
jerasure: https://github.com/tsuraan/Jerasure
ISA_L: https://github.com/01org/isa-l

You will also need PyECLib

https://github.com/openstack/pyeclib

Running in Ubuntu 14.04, the installation instructions worked perfectly.

You can run the following ec_types:
liberasurecode_rs_vand
jerasure_rs_vand
jerasure_rs_cauchy
isa_l_rs_vand
isa_l_rs_cauchy

Disk Simulator:

This will encode a file and write it to the nodes director (its purpose is to simulate storage
devices in a distributed file systems).  To run type

python diskSimulator.py <number data disks> <number coding disks> <ec_type> <filename to encode>

Your file needs to be in the OSFinalCode directory.

Disk Decoder:

This will decode a file.  Your settings need to be the same as they were when running disk simulator.
The disk decoder can handle up to m downed nodes.  To run type

python diskDecoder.py <data disks> <coding disks> <ec_type> <filename to decode> <new filename to be written to Client>
